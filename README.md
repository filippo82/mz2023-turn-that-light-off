# Turn that light off!

Repository for the ["Turn that light off!" project](https://now.makezurich.ch/project/90)
of [Make Zurich 2023](https://makezurich.ch/).

## The idea

* place light and motion sensors in a room
* if the light sensor detects that the light is on but the motion sensor detects that nobody is in the room, then a message is shown on a display
* you then have one minute of time to turn that light off
* if you turn it off within the agreed time window (default to one minute), then you get a point in a yet to be defined leaderbord
* once you get ten minutes, then you can buy yourself an icecream!
